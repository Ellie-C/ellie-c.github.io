	<h2>Web Design</h2>
		<p>Effective design is essential to being understood. Your voice matters. I use clean, user friendly design to convey your mission. I feel the strongest connection to fellow creatives, people who make things. Whether you are an artisan, a fine artist, or someone who creates space for people to heal, I will help you convey who you are and what you are capable of to your audience.</p>
